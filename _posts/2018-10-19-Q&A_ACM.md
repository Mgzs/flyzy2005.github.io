# The day before ACM UK&Ireland Regional round contest

## Q: How do you feel now?


## Q: Why you wanna participate this contest?

### A: If I don't try, I would never try. Just wanna give myself some challenges and take a look how people are much better than me. I've been doing lots of stupid things for a long time. It's time to start a new chapter.
